                    Imagine we would like to know the precise, instantaneous amplitude of a sinusoid.
                    Just looking at the function, this might not be so easy – we would have to determine
                    the maximum or minimum, and depending on the sinusoidal frequency this might take some time,
                    during which the amplitude might also have changed.

                <p class="text-lg mt-3">
                    But if we have a complex exponential with samples:
                </p>

 $$"></p>


                <p class="text-lg mt-2">
                    (We know x(n) but not A) we can easily determine the amplitude A only knowing one
                    complex valued sample x(n) by taking the magnitude of this complex exponential:
                </p>

                    appMathJax="$$ 
\begin{align*}
A &=\sqrt{\Re(x(n))^2+\Im(x(n))^2}\\
&=\sqrt{(A\cdot\cos(\Omega n))^2+(A\cdot\sin(\Omega n))^2}
\end{align*}
 $$"></p>
                

                <p class="text-lg mt-3">
                    Observe that this computation of A is independent of the time index n, so it can be
                    done at every time instance.

                <p class="text-lg mt-3">
                    So if we not only have the sine or cosine function in itself, but both, we can easily
                    compute the instantaneous amplitude in this way. This means, instead of just having the
                    sinusoidal function, we also have the 90° phase-shifted version of it, to compute
                    the amplitude. The problem is, if we only have one part (e.g., the real part),
                    how do we get this 90° phase-shifted version?
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg mt-3">
                    For example, look at the sine function. It already consists of two complex exponentials:
                </p>

    <p class="text-lg font-mono mt-3 text-center"
                    appMathJax="$$ 
\mathrm{sin}(\Omega n) = \frac{1}{2j}(e^{j\Omega n} − e^{−j\Omega n})
 $$"></p>
               

                <p class="text-lg mt-2">
                    We just have one exponential too many. If we look at it in the Fourier Domain, we see that
                    one exponential is at positive frequencies, and the other is at negative frequencies.
                    If we could remove one of the two exponentials, for instance at the negative frequencies,
                    we would have reached our goal of obtaining a complex exponential for amplitude computations.
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg mt-3">
                    So what we need is a filter, which attenuates the negative frequencies and leaves the
                    positive frequencies unchanged! So how do we obtain such a filter? First we formulate
                    our requirement in the frequency domain (the DTFT domain):

                <p class="text-lg mt-3">
                    We could multiply our signal spectrum with this frequency domain formulation
                    (which is often not practical), or in the time domain convolve with the impulse
                    response of the resulting filter obtained with inverse DTFT:

                    For n ≠ 0 this becomes:

                    Hence the resulting impulse response of this one-sided filter becomes:

                    This is now the resulting impulse response (in the time domain) of our filter,
                    which passes all the positive frequencies and attenuates the negative frequencies.

                    Here we can see that the first part with the delta function represents the real part,
                    which is the signal itself (signal convolved with the delta impulse), except for a factor of 2.
                    The second part represents the imaginary part of our one-sided signal (positive frequencies).

                <p class="text-lg mt-3">
                    Multiplying both parts with this factor of 2 for simplicity, we obtain the structure of:

                    (See also: [22]) Only this part, which creates the imaginary signal part, is the Hilbert
                    Transformer. We can use it to construct a filter that suppresses the negative frequencies.
                    This means, we take our original signal (the sinusoid) and define it as our real part.
                    Then we take the Hilbert filtered signal, filtered with the above hH(n), and define it
                    as our imaginary part. Then both together have a one-sided, positive only spectrum!
                    That also means, our Hilbert transform filter is our 90 degrees phase shifter that we
                    where looking for! You can also imagine, if the real part is a cos signal, then the Hilbert
                    Transformer generates the j · sin part.
