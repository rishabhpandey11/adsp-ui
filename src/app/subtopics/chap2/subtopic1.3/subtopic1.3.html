                <p class="text-lg mt-3">
                    The other assumption we made concerned the type of signal we quantize. What if we do not
                    have a uniformly distributed signal? As we saw, speech and audio signals are best modeled
                    by a Laplacian distribution or a Gaussian mixture model, and similar models apply for
                    audio signals in general.

                <p class="text-lg mt-3">
                    Even a simple sine wave does not fulfill the assumption of a uniform distribution.
                    What is the pdf of a simple sine wave? (see Figure 2.3).

                <p class="text-lg mt-3">
                    Observe: If a sinusoid represents a full-range signal, its values lie between
                    −A/2 and +A/2, just like in the previous examples.

                <p class="text-lg mt-3">
                    In summary, the SNR for a quantizer can be easily calculated using the derived formulas,
                    and the resulting SNR in dB increases by approximately 6 dB for every additional bit of
                    the quantizer, given the assumptions of uniform distribution and full-range signals.
