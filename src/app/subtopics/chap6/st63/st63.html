                    6.3 Reconstruction </h3>



                <p class="mt-4">
                    Observe that if the aliasing components do not overlap, we can perfectly reconstruct the signal
                    using a suitable filter. To prevent overlap, we filter the signal at the higher sampling rate before
                    aliasing occurs (as in the high-pass example). If overlap already exists at the lower sampling rate,
                    the different components cannot be separated and the signal is effectively "destroyed".
                </p>

                <p class="mt-4">
                    We can perfectly reconstruct the high-pass signal in our example using ideal filters, with
                    upsampling and ideal high-pass filtering.

                <p class="mt-4">
                    Observe that we violate the conventional Nyquist criterion, because our high-pass filter passes high
                    frequencies. However, sampling mirrors these frequencies to the lower range, allowing the
                    traditional Nyquist theorem to be applied. This approach is known as bandpass Nyquist and is
                    important in filter banks and wavelets. It states that we can perfectly reconstruct a bandpass
                    signal if we sample at twice the rate of the bandwidth of the signal, assuming ideal filters to
                    avoid spectral overlap of aliasing components.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-4">
                    In general, this holds for complex filters. For real-valued filters, this assumption works only if
                    the bandpass filters start at frequencies of (pi / N) * k, where k is an integer. Otherwise, overlap
                    with aliased components may occur, as illustrated in Figure 6.20.

                    6.3.1 Example
                </h3>



                <p class="mt-4">
                    We have a real-valued bandpass filter which starts its passband at a small frequency epsilon and
                    ends at epsilon + (pi / N). Since the filter is real-valued, the passband also appears at the
                    corresponding negative frequencies, from -epsilon to -(epsilon + pi / N). After multiplying with the
                    unit pulse train, we get one (out of N) aliasing component by shifting the negative passband by 2pi
                    / N to the positive frequencies. This results in the range from (pi / N - epsilon) to (2pi / N -
                    epsilon). Hence, there is an overlap in this range, and we could not perfectly reconstruct our
                    signal.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-4">
                    Therefore, sampling at twice the bandwidth for real-valued signals and filters only works if the
                    band limits are aligned with multiples of (pi / N) * k. To avoid overlapping aliasing components, we
                    can either increase the sampling rate (for example, to twice the usual rate, or 4 times the
                    bandwidth) to provide a "safety margin", or shift the bandpass signals in frequency so that they
                    align with the grid.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-4">
                    This restriction is not necessary for complex signals or filter banks. Complex filter banks are
                    used, for instance, in acoustic echo cancellation, where the sampling rate can be increased by a
                    fraction (less than a factor of 2) to reduce aliasing artifacts while keeping lower complexity.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-4"><strong>Summary:</strong> If our band boundaries are aligned with multiples of pi / N,
                    we can
                    downsample by N. Otherwise, for real-valued signals, it is safer to downsample by N/2. For complex,
                    one-sided signals (e.g., only positive frequencies), we can always downsample by N, regardless of
                    the bandpass placement.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-4">
                    Compare this with the standard Nyquist case: here we have a lowpass signal which we downsample and
                    reconstruct, as shown in Figure 6.21.

                <p class="mt-4">
                    This program can be controlled by keyboard and features sampling by a factor of N = 8 (keeping the
                    zeros). It also includes a low-pass filter before and after sampling to suppress the aliasing
                    components. Both sampling and filtering can be turned on and off. The program displays the magnitude
                    of the resulting DFT spectrum after reconstruction (after the last low-pass filter) in a waterfall
                    spectrogram:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The magnitude of the DFT is displayed as color (yellow is high, blue is low).</li>
                    <li>The horizontal axis is frequency (0 to Nyquist frequency).</li>
                    <li>The vertical axis is time (up is past).</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="mt-4">Start it with:</p>
                <pre><code>python pyrecspecwaterfallsampling.py</code></pre>

                <p class="mt-4"><strong>Observe:</strong> When sampling is turned on, aliasing artifacts are clearly
                    audible, and
                    they also appear as spectral copies in the waterfall spectrogram.</p>

                <p class="mt-4">When the low-pass filter is turned on, most aliasing artifacts are no longer audible,
                    and most of
                    them disappear from the waterfall spectrogram. However, the sound also becomes more muffled.</p>
