                    6.2 Upsampling </h3>



                <p class="mt-4">
                    What is still missing in our system is the upsampling, which is the opposite operation of
                    downsampling, for cases where we want to increase the sampling rate.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-4">
                    One common (but incorrect) approach to upsampling by a factor of N is to simply repeat each sample
                    N-1 times. This is equivalent to first inserting N-1 zeros after each sample, and then filtering the
                    resulting sequence with a low-pass filter whose impulse response is N ones. This is a very special
                    case.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-4">
                    In general, we upsample by first inserting N-1 zeros after each sample, and then applying an
                    interpolation filter (low-pass, high-pass, or band-pass as needed) to reconstruct the signal. This
                    process helps to select the correct spectral copy of the original signal.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-4">
                    We take the signal at the lower sampling rate as y(m), where m is the index at the lower sampling
                    rate. The upsampled signal, including the inserted zeros, is x<sup>d</sup>(n), where n is the index
                    at the higher sampling rate. This is simply the reverse of the final step in downsampling.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-4">
                    From downsampling, we have the relation:
                </p>

                <p class="text-center mt-3 text-lg font-mono">
                    X<sup>d</sup>(Omega) = Y(Omega * N)
                </p>

                <p class="mt-4">
                    Or equivalently:
                </p>

                <p class="text-center mt-3 text-lg font-mono">
                    X<sup>d</sup>(Omega / N) = Y(Omega)
                </p>

                <p class="mt-4">
                    Here we are going from y(m) to the upsampled signal x<sup>d</sup>(n). For example, if a frequency
                    component was at pi before upsampling, it becomes pi / 2 for the upsampled signal when N=2. This
                    effectively extends the frequency range.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-4">
                    Since the upsampled signal x<sup>d</sup>(n) includes zeros, its spectrum is again periodic in
                    frequency, similar to the downsampling case. The periodicity remains because the original signal was
                    2*pi periodic, and after upsampling, the frequency scale adjusts accordingly.
