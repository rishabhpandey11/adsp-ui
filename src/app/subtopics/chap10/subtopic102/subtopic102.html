                <p class="mt-4"><strong>Definition:</strong> Minimum-phase filters are causal and stable systems where
                    the poles and
                    zeros lie inside or on the unit circle in the z-plane. For a given magnitude response, they have the
                    minimum possible group delay.</p>

                <p class="mt-4"><strong>Properties:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Minimum-phase filters have their energy concentrated at the beginning of the impulse response.
                    </li>
                    <li>These filters are unique for a given magnitude response.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="mt-4"><strong>All-Pass Decomposition:</strong> A transfer function can be factored into a
                    minimum-phase
                    system and an all-pass filter. The all-pass component does not affect the magnitude but alters the
                    phase.</p>

                <p><strong>Applications:</strong> Used in speech processing and audio equalization, where low group
                    delay is crucial.</p>

                <p class="mt-4"><strong>Design:</strong> Conversion of a non-minimum-phase system to minimum-phase is
                    achieved by
                    reflecting zeros outside the unit circle into the inside.</p>

                <p class="mt-4"><strong>Python Implementation:</strong> Examples involve designing, analyzing, and
                    implementing
                    minimum-phase filters using Python libraries such as NumPy and SciPy.</p>
